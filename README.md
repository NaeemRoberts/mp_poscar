# Materials Project POSCAR Generator 

Hello! If you've come across this repo, you're probably as new to VASP software as I am at the time that I am writing this README. Turns out, The Materials Project has vasp-relevant information that I need. Atomic positions specifically. All this is great but, to my knowledge there is currently no way of getting a correctly formatted POSCAR file. 

## What I want this to do: 

- read the atomic positions from the Materials Project.
- Add a title (the name is at the users discretion, but is usually something relevant to the crystal strucuture)
- Lattice parameter(users discretion)
- Unscaled Lattice parameters
- Add atom types
- number of atoms
- atomic basis
- convert fractional coordinates to cartesian
